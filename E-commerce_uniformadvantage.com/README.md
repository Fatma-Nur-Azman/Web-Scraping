# E-Commerce Product Pricing Analysis Platform

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data processing workflow, from web scraping and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualizing data insights using interactive dashboards. The dataset includes information about various products such as categories, names, prices, and genders. This dataset was extracted from an e-commerce website, specifically to support a client request for price analysis.

## Project Goals
- Extract data from multiple sources using web scraping.
- Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Create interactive visualizations to identify patterns and trends.
- Demonstrate expertise in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.

## Key Features
- **Web Scraping:** Built pipelines to collect data from various sources. Each color and size variant of the products was extracted separately to ensure detailed and granular analysis.
- **Data Analysis:** Performed comprehensive EDA to clean and process raw data.
- **Visualizations:** Created insightful dashboards to represent:
  - Average prices by category.
  - Price comparisons by gender.
  - Discounted vs original prices.

## Visual Insights
### 1. Average Original Price by Category
This bar chart highlights the average original price for each product category, providing a clear understanding of which categories are priced higher.

### 2. Average Original Price by Sex
This visualization compares the average original prices of products targeted at men and women.

### 3. Discounted Price vs Original Price
A scatter plot shows the relationship between original and discounted prices, segmented by gender.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Data processing and visualization.
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit.
- **Visualization Tools:** Created interactive dashboards using Streamlit.
- **ETL Workflow:** Demonstrated end-to-end data handling expertise.
