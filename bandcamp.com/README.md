This project is designed to automatically scrape album names, artist names, and price information from the **Bandcamp** website using **Selenium** and **BeautifulSoup**. Web scraping is a powerful method for structuring unformatted data from the internet, and through this project, you will learn how to make the most out of the data available on Bandcamp.

## 🚀 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to extract data related to albums (title, artist, and price) under the "genre" section of **Bandcamp**. The extracted data is then saved in a CSV format, which can be used for further analysis or other applications.

## 🔧 Technologies and Libraries Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Selenium**: Automates web browsers to load dynamic content.
- **BeautifulSoup**: Used to parse HTML and XML documents.
- **Pandas**: Helps in converting the extracted data into structured formats.

## 💻 Project Steps
1. **Website Analysis**: Inspecting the "genre" pages and album details on Bandcamp.
2. **Data Extraction**: Using Selenium to open the page and BeautifulSoup to extract album, artist, and price details.
3. **Data Storage**: Saving the extracted data to a CSV file.

## 🛠 Setup and Run Instructions
1. Install the required packages for the project:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
